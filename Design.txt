Main design:
	the probability for an ant traveling from one destination to another destination is main decided by two factors: the pheromones and the distance between these two dests
	after traveling, the ant will leave pheromones on the route it traveled
	repeat these process, the pheromones on every route are different so that it can have great influence in leading the ant to the shortest route.

Detailed process:
1. Read data from a csv file
The format of csv file is :
1st line: x,y
after the 1st line: the x coordinate value, the y coordinate value
2. x value and y value is stored in two separated arrays, dest_x, dest_y
3. some metrics:
	dis[i][j]: The distance between the destination [i] and destination [j]
phe[i][j]: The pheromones in the route between the destination [i] and destination [j]
	traveled[i][j]: The chart records the traveling process of every ant, the ant[i] has been     to the dest[j]
4. iterations:
	1.put every ant in a random dest, record this dest in the traveled chart
	2.creat a new array not_traveled[j], record the dest that this ant hasnâ€™t been to, the size of the array is the num_of_dest - num_of_traveled
	3.calculate the probability for this ant traveling to every not_travled dest in the next loop
	prob=prob[k] = (phe[now][next]^alpha) *((1/dis[now][next])^beta)
	alpha and beta are parameters 
	4.using the probability and random number to decide which dest to go then
	for example:
		prob to dest 0,1, 2 is 0.3, 0.2, 0.5
cumsum the prob 0, 1, 2 will be 0.3, 0.5, 1
create a random number between 0 and 1
if random=0.4123, cumsum[0]<0.4123<cumsum[1], so the ant goes to dest 1

5. repeat this process until every ant has traveled all the dests
	6. increase the pheromones based on the finished traveled charted and the total distance this ant traveled, if the total distance is shorter, this ant can leave more pheromones
		phe_delta=Q/total_dis
		phe=rho*phe + phe_delta
		Q and rho are parameters
	7. clear the traveled chart and repeated again
5. record the best route in the last iteration and plot
